# Transformer Architecture Overview

This README provides a detailed explanation of the Transformer architecture, which is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and more. The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with key components like input embeddings, positional encoding, multi-head attention, and feed-forward layers.

## Introduction

The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. It revolutionized NLP by replacing recurrent and convolutional layers with self-attention mechanisms, enabling parallelization and better long-range dependency modeling.

This README explains the architecture's flow, components, and functionality in a structured manner.

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Input Embedding
- Converts input tokens (words or subwords) into dense vector representations.
- Each token is mapped to a fixed-size vector that captures its semantic meaning.

### 2. Positional Encoding
- Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence since the Transformer does not inherently understand order.
- Encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide sequential context.

### 3. Encoder Layer
- Consists of two main components:
  - **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
  - **Feed-Forward Network**: A simple fully connected network applied to each position independently.

### 4. Decoder Layer
- Similar to the encoder but includes an additional **Masked Multi-Head Attention** layer:
  - Ensures that predictions for a particular position depend only on known outputs at previous positions (autoregressive property).

### 5. Output Layer
- Produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each position in the output sequence.
- Typically implemented using a softmax function.

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Tokens are converted into embeddings and combined with positional encodings.
   
2. **Encoding**:
   - The input embeddings pass through multiple stacked encoder layers.
   - Each layer applies self-attention and feed-forward transformations.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The decoder processes the encoded representation along with previously generated tokens (during inference).
   - Masked attention ensures that future tokens are not visible during prediction.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The final decoder output is passed through a linear layer followed by softmax to produce probabilities for each word in the vocabulary.

## Applications

The Transformer architecture has been applied to a wide range of tasks, including:
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).
- **Text Summarization**: Generating concise summaries of long documents.
- **Question Answering**: Providing answers to questions based on context.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text.
- **Image Captioning**: Generating descriptive captions for images.
